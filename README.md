# Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

I am a passionate and results-driven Data Scientist and Analyst with a strong foundation in data management, statistical analysis, and machine learning. I have a Master's Degree in Data Science and a Graduate Certificate in Biostatistics. My academic background in research has provided me with a solid understanding of data science principles, while my hands-on experience in analyzing complex datasets, developing models, and creating actionable insights has honed my ability to solve real-world problems.

With expertise in Python, R, and other analytical tools, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization to machine learning applications. I have a proven track record of applying advanced algorithms and statistical models to generate meaningful insights, drive decision-making, and deliver impactful results for various stakeholders.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to collaborate cross-functionally, manage large datasets, and communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. My dedication to continuous learning and my commitment to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies in data science ensures that I bring innovative solutions to every project I tackle.

## Committee Work
Between 2022 and 2024, I worked as a co-chair and leader on the Electronic Data Capture NACC committees. In this role, I helped develop NIH data management plans, psychometric data capture standardization, and data best practices. I worked and led 3 committees over the two years and am incredibly proud of the deliverables we created for our research community.
